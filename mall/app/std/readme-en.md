# std:

- Common unified standard for business: error code/configuration/convention

## Difference from pkg directory:

- pkg/ is completely unrelated to business and can be ported to code used outside the project
- std/ is business-related, however, is a project-wide, general-purpose code

## illustrate:

- Standard definition of the project itself:
    - public error code
    - Common configuration file definition format
    - Public interface parameter convention specification



```bash

err code:

config fmt:

req/resp arg fmt:


```



## Generate:


```bash


make proto

```
